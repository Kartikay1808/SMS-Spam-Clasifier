 **SMS-Spam-Clasifier**
A good text classifier is a classifier that efficiently categorizes large sets of text documents in a reasonable time frame and with acceptable accuracy, and that provides classification rules that are humanly readable for possible fine-tuning. If the training of the classifier is also quick, this could become in some application domains a good asset for the classifier. Many techniques and algorithms for automatic text categorization have been devised.

The text classification task can be defined as assigning category labels to new documents based on the knowledge gained in a classification system at the training stage. In the training phase, we are given a set of documents with class labels attached, and a classification system is built using a learning method. Classification is an important task in both data mining and machine learning communities, however, most of the learning approaches in text categorization are coming from machine learning research.
